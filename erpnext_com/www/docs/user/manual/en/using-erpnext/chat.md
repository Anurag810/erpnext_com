# Chat

You can send and receive messages from the system by using the Messages tool. 

Explore > Tools > Chat

If you send a message to a user, and the user is logged in, it will appear as a pop-up message and the unread messages counter in the top toolbar will be
updated.

This tool can be used to maintain internal communications within your organization.
